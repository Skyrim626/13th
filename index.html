                        <strong>Dear Desirie Zin,</strong>
                        <p>
                            I have received your letter, and I thank you for expressing your deepest love and care to me
                            every single day, amor. Yes, baby, today we celebrated the 13th monthsary of our bond, and
                            there are more blessings to come for us, amor. Let us stay strong with compassion as we
                            pursue our goals until our chapters finally merge together.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I am proud of you, too, amor. You've started to change not just for me but for yourself as
                            well. I love you, and you already know that, amor. Even when we have arguments or face
                            problems, we settle them together. Our love may not be perfect, amor, but it is eternal for
                            us. As two souls wandering across the sands of time, we met, and fate destined us to be
                            together.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We, amor, shall continue further until we reach our peak and full potential. I love you not
                            just for your appearance, but also for your beautiful personality. One day, amor, you and I
                            shall rule for eternity.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This message is part of me that lives in a fantasy while embracing reality. I will love you
                            until the ends of the earth.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            From your soulmate,
                            <br />
